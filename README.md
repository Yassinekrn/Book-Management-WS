## Overview

The **Book Management Service** is a RESTful web service built with **Spring Boot** that handles all book-related operations in a library management system. It provides endpoints to manage books, including adding, updating, deleting, and searching for books in the system. This service is part of a larger **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** for a library system and can communicate with other services like Loan Management and User Management.

## Features

-   üìñ **Add new books**: Add new books to the library's collection.
-   üîç **Search for books**: Search books by title, author, genre, or ISBN.
-   ‚úèÔ∏è **Update book information**: Modify existing book details.
-   üóëÔ∏è **Delete books**: Remove books from the system.
-   üìö **Check book availability**: Find out if a book is available for loan or currently on loan.

## Technologies

-   **Java** with **Spring Boot** to build and manage the overall application
-   **Maven** for project management
-   **MySQL** for storing book data and related information
-   **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions
-   **Spring Web** for RESTful API creation
-   **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code
-   **Jersey (JAX-RS)**: used to create RESTful web services and handle HTTP requests for the Book Management service

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

-   Java 17+
-   Maven 3.x
-   MySQL for persistent storage

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yassinekrn/book_management_web_service.git
    cd book_management_web_service
    ```

2. **Update application properties:**
   If using H2/PostgreSQL, update the database connection in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    ```

3. **Build and run the application:**

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4. The service will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Using the Endpoints

You can use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test the endpoints:

-   **Add a new book**:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/books -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
      "title": "The Great Gatsby",
      "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
      "isbn": "9780743273565",
      "genre": "Classic Fiction",
      "publishedYear": 1925,
      "publisher": "Scribner",
      "description": "A novel about the American dream, wealth, and social upheaval in the 1920s.",
      "totalCopies": 10,
      "availableCopies": 10
    }'
    ```

-   **Search for a book by title**:
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:8080/books/search?title=The%20Great%20Gatsby"
    ```

## Database

By default, the application uses **MySQL**, but it can be easily configured to use **PostgreSQL** or **H2** according to your personal needs. Just update the `application.properties` file accordingly.

## Future Improvements

-   Implement advanced search with filters.
-   Add support for book reservations.
